# What output does the pipeline produce?
Placeholders are in in parentheses.

## Rarefaction
For each data set that undergoes rarefaction, three files are exported to the project's 'Output' directory:
- **{datasetID}\_rarefaction_curves_subsample\_{subsample_size}.png:** Rarefaction curves for each plot. Rarefied diversity is visualized by horizontal lines. The vertical line marks the subsample size, which is also featured in the file's name.
- **{datasetID}\_rarefaction_curve_slopes_subsample\_{subsample_size}.csv:** As the the x-axis in rarefaction plots can be quasi-logarithmic (i.e. its increments are way larger than the y-axis' increments), interpreting these graphs might be challenging. To facilitate their interpretation, this file lists the slope of each rarefaction curve at the subsampling size selected.
- **{datasetID}_rarefaction_curve_slopes_subsample\_{subsample_size}.png:** A graphical representation of the information stored in {datasetID}\_rarefaction_curve_slopes_subsample\_{subsample_size}.csv.

## Final quality control
- **FQC_env_var_composite_complete.csv:** The quality-controlled composite, after excluding columns that have non-numeric content, are mono-value or feature NA/NaN/Inf. No variables selection was performed on this ouput. Use this file if you would like to perform variables selection yourself or subset it for the variables you are most interested in.

## Variables selection
- **VS_VIF\{VIF_threshold}\_VS_analysed_vars:** All variables used in variables selection for the VIF threshold specified.
- **VS_VIF\{VIF_threshold}\_VS_retained_vars_scores.csv:** Variables retained and their VIF scores after excluding cross-correlated variables by a stepwise variance inflation factor analysis with the VIF threshold specified. 
- **VS_VIF\{VIF_threshold}\_VS_composite.csv:** FQC_env_var_composite_complete after excluding all variables deemed cross-correlated (i.e. only the variables listed in VS_VIF\{VIF_threshold}\_VS_retained_vars_scores.csv are featured here).
- **VS_VIF\{VIF_threshold}\_VS_corr_matrix.csv:** Pairwise Pearson's r for all variables retained at the VIF threshold specified. This might facilitate downstream model interpretation.
- **VS_VIF\{VIF_threshold}\_VS_excluded_vars.csv:** Variables that have been excluded at the VIF threshold specified.

## Metadata compilation
**metadata_compiled_variables:** The metadata to the variables compiled in FQC_env_var_composite_complete.csv. Information is obtained from the data sets' datastructure files.

## General
**console_output.txt:** All prompts generated by the pipeline. This is most useful if your console is set up in a way that does not retain all lines produced by this pipeline. Scan this file for warnings/error.
